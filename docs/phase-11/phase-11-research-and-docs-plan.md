# Phase 11 — Documentation and Examples: Research Findings & Plan

This document synthesizes the Phase 11 requirements from `master-mcp-definition.md` and compiles best practices, tooling options, and a concrete documentation architecture for the Master MCP Server. It aligns with Phases 1–10 (auth, module loading, routing, core server, configuration, OAuth flows, utilities, testing, deployment) and sets up maintainable, verifiable documentation and examples.

## 1) Phase 11 Requirements (from master-mcp-definition.md)

- Examples (examples/):
  - `simple-setup.yaml` (exists), `basic.yaml` (exists)
  - Add: `mixed-auth.yaml`, `enterprise.yaml`, `development.yaml`
- Integration guide covering:
  - Migrating existing MCP servers into the Master
  - OAuth configuration for different providers
  - Troubleshooting authentication issues
  - Performance tuning and scaling
  - Security best practices
- Success criteria: “Complete documentation and examples” (see Success Criteria list)
- Code quality requirement: “Documentation: JSDoc for all public APIs”

Implication: We need both authored docs (guides, tutorials, deployment, troubleshooting) and generated docs (API, configuration reference). Examples must be runnable and map to deployment targets (Node, Workers, Docker, Koyeb) and auth strategies.

## 2) Documentation Architecture (structure and responsibilities)

Recommended repo structure additions (builds on existing `docs/architecture`, `docs/testing`):

- `README.md`: High-level overview, Quickstart, links to docs and examples.
- `docs/`
  - `getting-started.md` — First-run setup for Node and Workers.
  - `concepts/`
    - `mcp-master-overview.md` — What aggregation means, responsibilities, boundaries.
    - `auth-strategies.md` — MASTER_OAUTH, DELEGATE_OAUTH, PROXY_OAUTH, BYPASS_AUTH (flows + decision matrix).
  - `configuration/`
    - `config-reference.md` — Definitive config doc (generated + annotated examples).
    - `config-examples.md` — Deep-dive of the YAML examples.
  - `guides/`
    - `migrate-existing-servers.md` — How to bring existing MCP servers under the Master.
    - `oauth-setup.md` — OAuth setup per provider (GitHub, Google, generic OIDC), scopes, redirect URIs.
    - `observability.md` — Logs, metrics, health checks, debugging failed routes.
    - `security.md` — Token storage, encryption, least privilege, secrets management.
    - `performance.md` — Load balancing, health checks, backoff, circuit breakers.
  - `deploy/`
    - `node.md` — Run on Node (local/dev/prod), PM2/systemd notes.
    - `docker.md` — Build, run, compose, volumes, healthcheck, networking.
    - `workers.md` — Cloudflare Workers specifics, KV, Durable Objects, `wrangler.toml`.
    - `koyeb.md` — Koyeb setup, autoscaling, env injection, storage.
  - `examples/`
    - `README.md` — Catalog of runnable examples with prerequisites and how to verify.
  - `troubleshooting.md` — Auth, runtime differences, network, ports, CORS, redirects.
  - `api/` (generated) — TypeDoc Markdown output for public API surface.
  - `contributing.md` — Dev setup, scripts, coding standards, test strategy, docs conventions.

Notes:
- Keep authored docs in Markdown for GitHub-first consumption; consider site generation later (e.g., Docusaurus/VitePress) with minimal friction.
- Prefer Mermaid for sequence diagrams (auth flows, routing) embedded in Markdown.

## 3) API Documentation Strategy (TypeScript-first)

- Authoring style: TSDoc comments on all public types, interfaces, classes, and functions (Code Quality requirement aligns with JSDoc; TSDoc is compatible and more TS-native).
- Tooling:
  - TypeDoc for API reference.
  - `typedoc-plugin-markdown` to emit Markdown into `docs/api/` for GitHub browsing.
  - Optional (for larger projects): Microsoft API Extractor + API Documenter to enforce a stable public API surface and generate docs. Start with TypeDoc and only adopt Extractor if public API grows significantly.
- Configuration reference generation:
  - Generate JSON Schema for `MasterConfig` and related types for validation and docs. Two common options:
    - `ts-json-schema-generator` directly from TypeScript types; or
    - Model config with Zod and use `zod-to-json-schema` (if adopting Zod for runtime validation).
  - Render the schema into `docs/configuration/config-reference.md` with examples and links to sample YAML.
- Scripts (proposed in `package.json`):
  - `docs:api`: `typedoc --plugin typedoc-plugin-markdown --out docs/api src`
  - `docs:config`: generate JSON schema then render Markdown (simple Node script)
  - `docs:build`: runs `docs:api` and `docs:config`
  - `docs:check`: lints Markdown and validates example YAML against schema

## 4) Examples Strategy (runnable and verifiable)

Examples must be minimal, runnable, self-describing, and cover auth/deployment matrices. Include `.env.example` files and a short `README.md` per example with: prerequisites, commands, expected result, and verification steps.

Proposed catalog additions:

- `examples/sample-configs/` (config-only)
  - `simple-setup.yaml` (exists): Node, single local server, BYPASS_AUTH.
  - `basic.yaml` (exists): Node, single local server, MASTER_OAUTH.
  - `mixed-auth.yaml`: Mix of MASTER_OAUTH, DELEGATE_OAUTH, PROXY_OAUTH, BYPASS_AUTH.
  - `enterprise.yaml`: Enterprise SSO (OIDC) + external OAuth delegation to specific servers.
  - `development.yaml`: Local dev workflow with hot reload, verbose logging, mock OAuth provider.

- Runnable examples (each with its own README):
  - `examples/node-basic/`: Run master locally with `simple-setup.yaml` and a mock backend server.
  - `examples/oauth-delegation/`: Delegate OAuth to a mock server; includes a tiny fake OAuth provider + callback handler.
  - `examples/docker/`: Dockerfile + docker-compose that mounts `examples/sample-configs/*` and a mock server; includes health check and logs.
  - `examples/workers/`: Cloudflare Workers version with KV + Durable Objects scaffold, `wrangler.toml`, and a mock request flow.
  - `examples/koyeb/`: Koyeb YAML + instructions to deploy prebuilt image; env injection and health checks.

Verification pattern:
- Provide a `scripts/verify-example.mjs` that:
  - Starts the example target (local or docker compose).
  - Calls `/health` and one representative MCP call through the master.
  - Checks for expected response fields and prints a PASS/FAIL summary.
  - Used by CI and by users to validate setup.

## 5) Tutorials and Guides (by persona)

Persona-targeted guides increase clarity and adoption. Suggested personas:

- Developers (building against MCP):
  - Quickstart: connect a client to the Master MCP, list tools, call a tool.
  - Adding a new backend server, conflict resolution for tools/resources, best practices for schemas.
  - Local dev with `development.yaml` and test fixtures.

- Operators (deploying/running the Master):
  - Node deployment with PM2/systemd.
  - Docker deployment (single node and compose), volumes, health checks.
  - Workers deployment with KV/DO setup; limits and runtime differences.
  - Koyeb deployment with autoscaling and storage.
  - Monitoring, logging, alerts.

- Integrators (auth and platform integration):
  - OAuth provider setup (GitHub/Google/OIDC): client registration, scopes, redirect URIs.
  - Mapping auth strategies per server; choosing MASTER vs DELEGATE vs PROXY vs BYPASS.
  - Enterprise SSO patterns and zero-trust network considerations.

Each guide should include:
- Prerequisites with explicit versions.
- Step-by-step actions with copy-paste commands.
- Validation step (curl or tiny script) to confirm success.
- Rollback/cleanup instructions.

## 6) Deployment Guides (platform specifics)

Node.js (docs/deploy/node.md)
- Local dev (ts-node) and production (compiled JS) paths.
- Env var matrix (PORT, OAUTH_*, storage keys).
- Health check endpoint usage and log routing.

Docker (docs/deploy/docker.md)
- Multi-stage build matching Phase 10.
- Volume layout for server repositories and persistent token store.
- Network and port exposure examples; compose file with healthcheck.

Cloudflare Workers (docs/deploy/workers.md)
- Worker-specific OAuth callbacks, KV for token store, Durable Object for state.
- How to adapt Node-only features (child processes, fs) — call out what is disabled and the supported patterns.
- `wrangler.toml` template and dev workflow with `wrangler dev`.

Koyeb (docs/deploy/koyeb.md)
- Using `koyeb.yaml` from Phase 10, env injection and storage.
- Health checks, autoscaling boundaries, log access.

## 7) Usage Examples for OAuth and MCP Integration

For each auth strategy, include:
- Sequence diagram (Mermaid) for the flow.
- Minimal config YAML snippet.
- Sample request/response for `list_tools`, `call_tool`, `list_resources`, `read_resource` through the Master.
- Common pitfalls and corresponding troubleshooting links.

Example flows to document:
- MASTER_OAUTH: Validate client token at the Master; forward to backend without per-server auth.
- DELEGATE_OAUTH: Master issues delegation; client completes server-specific OAuth; Master stores server token keyed by client.
- PROXY_OAUTH: Master exchanges/obtains a server token and injects it while proxying requests.
- BYPASS_AUTH: No auth for the backend; client auth enforced only at the Master.

## 8) Troubleshooting Topics (common issues and resolutions)

- OAuth: invalid state, wrong redirect URI, token expiration, missing scopes, clock skew.
- Workers constraints: inability to spawn processes, fs limitations, crypto APIs, solution patterns.
- Docker/Koyeb: port collisions, env var misconfig, health check failures, volume permissions.
- Aggregation: tool/resource name conflicts, capability refresh after server restart.
- Routing: retries, backoff, circuit breaker behavior and tuning.
- Configuration: schema validation errors, env var interpolation mistakes.

Each entry should have: symptom, root cause, resolution, and prevention.

## 9) Contributing & Development Setup

- Prerequisites: Node LTS, npm/pnpm, optional Python for mixed backends.
- Install, build targets (Node and Workers), run tests (Phase 9), run examples.
- Coding standards: ESLint/Prettier configs, TSDoc conventions, commit hygiene.
- Running API docs generation and validating example YAML against schema.
- How to write a new example and add it to the catalog.

## 10) Cross-Platform Considerations (Node vs Workers)

- Document feature availability and constraints in a small matrix (e.g., child process = Node-only; token storage = Node(fs)/Workers(KV); networking differences).
- Provide alternate code paths or configuration flags where necessary.
- Ensure examples for Workers avoid Node-only APIs.

## 11) CI Hooks and Quality Gates (future-friendly)

- Validate that `docs/api` is up to date (diff on PRs) and that TSDoc coverage does not regress.
- Lint docs: Markdown lint, dead-link checker, and example YAML schema validation.
- Optional: Run example verification scripts in CI for smoke validation.

---

With this plan, Phase 11 can be executed incrementally: seed the structure, wire API/config generation, add the example configs and runnable showcases, then layer on persona-driven guides. The verification script pattern bridges examples and testing (Phase 9) and makes docs continuously trustworthy.

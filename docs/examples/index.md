# Examples

Real-world usage patterns for Node and Workers with routing, OAuth, and configuration.

- Basic Node Aggregator — minimal end-to-end setup
- Cloudflare Worker — Workers runtime entry
- Advanced Routing — retries, circuit-breaking, load balancing
- OAuth Delegation — per-backend OAuth flows
- Testing Patterns — integrate with the test utilities

Each example has a runnable skeleton under `/examples/*` with a README.

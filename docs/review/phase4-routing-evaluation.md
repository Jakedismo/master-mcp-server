# Phase 4 Evaluation — Request Routing System

Agent: rubric-grader-agent-mebe99uo-mve74 (rubric-grader)
Date: 2025-08-14

## Summary

Phase 4 delivers a robust routing layer with circuit breaking, retries, load balancing, and dynamic route resolution. Integration points with CapabilityAggregator (Phase 3) and MultiAuthManager (Phase 2) are present and thoughtfully wired. Cross‑platform considerations are largely respected by relying on `fetch` and platform‑neutral logic. A few improvements around request timeouts, error shapes, and TypeScript lib targeting would further harden the implementation.

Decision: PASS (Average ≥ 8)

## Scores (1–10)

1) Requirements Completeness — 9/10
- RequestRouter integrates CircuitBreaker, RetryHandler, LoadBalancer, and RouteRegistry; uses CapabilityAggregator for name mapping; supports auth callback for MultiAuth.
- Files: `src/modules/request-router.ts`, `src/routing/*`, `src/modules/capability-aggregator.ts`.

2) Circuit Breaker Implementation — 8/10
- Per‑instance breaker keyed by `serverId::instanceId` with closed/open/half‑open states, success thresholds, recovery timeout, and gating via `canExecute`/`execute`.
- Lacks a rolling time window but meets functional needs; good half‑open handling.
- Files: `src/routing/circuit-breaker.ts`, usage in `route-registry.ts`.

3) Retry Logic — 8/10
- Exponential backoff with configurable base, factor, max delay, and full jitter; configurable retry policy for network/5xx/408/429.
- Missing per‑attempt timeout/AbortController and `Retry-After` handling; otherwise solid.
- Files: `src/routing/retry-handler.ts`, usage in `request-router.ts`.

4) Load Balancing — 8/10
- Supports `round_robin`, `weighted`, and `health` strategies; health strategy prefers highest `healthScore` with RR tie‑breaks.
- Weighted selection is probabilistic (not weighted RR) but acceptable; integrates with breaker filtering.
- Files: `src/routing/load-balancer.ts`, `src/routing/route-registry.ts`.

5) Route Registry — 9/10
- Dynamic instance lookup with fallback to primary endpoint; caches resolutions with TTL; filters by breaker; adjusts per‑instance health on success/failure.
- Clean separation of concerns and efficient fast‑path cache.
- Files: `src/routing/route-registry.ts`.

6) Authentication Integration — 9/10
- Router accepts an auth header provider compatible with `MultiAuthManager.prepareAuthForBackend`. Delegation is surfaced to the caller; aggregator discovery avoids delegation loops.
- Suggest standardizing delegation response shape.
- Files: `src/auth/multi-auth-manager.ts`, `src/server/master-server.ts`, `src/modules/request-router.ts`.

7) Cross‑Platform Compatibility — 8/10
- Router and routing components use `fetch` and platform‑neutral primitives; worker build excludes Node‑only files; good separation in tsconfigs.
- Node tsconfig omits `DOM` libs while router uses `RequestInit`/`Response` types, which may cause TS errors under Node builds; add `DOM` lib or local type shims.
- Files: `tsconfig.worker.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, routing files.

8) Code Quality & Reliability — 8/10
- Strong typing, clean structure, and clear logging. Health/circuit integration improves resilience.
- Missing request timeouts and header sanitation limit worst‑case latency and security hardening. Error shapes could be more uniform.

Average: 8.375 — PASS

## Reliability & Performance Assessment

- Retries: Exponential backoff with full jitter reduces contention; good defaults and configurability.
- Circuit Breaking: Effective per‑instance gating and half‑open probing; fast‑fail on open circuits.
- Load Balancing: Round‑robin default with health‑aware and weighted alternatives; integrates with breaker filtering.
- Caching: RouteRegistry TTL cache (default 5s) reduces resolve overhead; suitable for typical workloads.
- Gaps: No per‑attempt timeout/AbortController; slow upstreams can stall. No `Retry-After` respect on 429/503.

## Verification Notes

- RequestRouter
  - Maps aggregated names via CapabilityAggregator (`getMappingForTool/Resource`) with safe dot‑split fallback.
  - Builds backend URLs with helper `ensureTrailingSlash` and configurable endpoints.
  - Integrates CircuitBreaker `execute()` and updates RouteRegistry success/failure.
  - Wraps `fetch` in RetryHandler; throws on non‑OK to trigger policy.
  - Surfaces OAuth delegation when provided by auth provider.

- CircuitBreaker
  - States: `closed` → `open` (threshold) → `half_open` (after timeout) → `closed` (successes) or `open` (failure).
  - Single in‑flight trial in half‑open via `halfOpenInProgress`.

- RetryHandler
  - Policy fields: `maxRetries`, `baseDelayMs`, `maxDelayMs`, `backoffFactor`, `jitter`, `retryOn`.
  - Handles network errors and status‑based retries (5xx, 408, 429). Logs on retry.

- LoadBalancer
  - Round‑robin index per key; probabilistic weighted pick; health strategy prefers highest `healthScore` with RR tie.

- RouteRegistry
  - Resolves instances per serverId; filters by circuit allowance; caches resolution; nudges `healthScore` on outcomes.

- Auth Integration
  - `MasterServer.setAuthHeaderProvider(...)` wires `MultiAuthManager`; aggregator discovery avoids delegation by falling back to pass‑through.

## Overall Completion

Phase 4 implementation meets the objectives: resilient request routing with breaker, retry, load balancing, dynamic route selection, and auth integration. Cross‑platform goals are mostly satisfied, pending minor TS lib alignment for Node builds. The system should behave reliably under common failure modes, with clear extension points for further hardening.

## Recommendations (Prioritized)

1) Add per‑attempt timeouts using `AbortController` and a configurable `timeoutMs` in routing config; ensure breaker updates on timeouts.
2) Respect `Retry-After` for 429/503 and cap total retry budget.
3) Standardize OAuth delegation responses (e.g., `content.type = 'oauth_delegation'` with a `delegation` payload) for both tools and resources.
4) Include `DOM` lib in Node tsconfig or add local type shims for `RequestInit`/`Response` to avoid TS build issues under Node.
5) Sanitize forwarded headers (strip hop‑by‑hop; set `accept: application/json`; `redirect: 'manual'` in fetch options).
6) Consider a rolling window/error‑rate breaker variant and optional latency‑aware load balancing.
7) Harmonize error shapes (tools/resources) and add correlation IDs for observability.

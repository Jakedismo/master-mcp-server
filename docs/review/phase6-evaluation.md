# Phase 6 Evaluation — Configuration System

Agent: rubric-grader-agent-meckzh4n-d5kay (rubric-grader)
Date: 2025-08-15
Scope: Config system implementation (loader, validator, environment, secrets, hot‑reload, cross‑platform) and integration with Phases 1–5.

## Summary
Phase 6 delivers a functional, layered configuration system with schema validation, environment overrides, secret resolution, and hot‑reload wiring. Node.js support is strong: base+env JSON files merge cleanly with env and CLI overrides; secrets are handled securely with AES‑GCM and log redaction; and the Master server reacts to config changes at runtime. Cross‑platform support is partial: Workers build currently excludes the config subsystem and crypto relies on Node APIs. Validation is pragmatic via a lightweight JSON‑Schema validator but lacks advanced invariants and discriminated unions. Overall, the implementation meets the phase requirements with a few notable gaps.

## Rubric Scores (1–10)
- Requirements Completeness: 9 — All key components implemented (ConfigLoader, SchemaValidator, EnvironmentManager, SecretManager, enhanced ConfigManager, env‑specific configs) with file/env/CLI sources and merging.
- Schema Validation: 8 — Custom JSON‑Schema validator covers required/enum/type/format and nested validation; lacks cross‑field constraints and strategy‑specific refinements.
- Environment Management: 8 — Multi‑env detection (MASTER_ENV/NODE_ENV), base+env layering, env var and CLI dotted overrides; no local overrides/extends yet.
- Security Implementation: 8 — Secrets via AES‑GCM, fail‑fast in prod when key missing, redaction, rotation helper; Node‑only crypto limits Worker portability.
- Configuration Loading: 9 — Supports JSON+YAML (Node), environment overrides, CLI deep overrides, deep‑merge semantics (arrays replace), schema validation and secret resolution.
- Hot‑Reload Capabilities: 7 — Node file watcher with apply hooks updates servers/routing; warns on non‑hot fields (port) but no transactional apply/rollback or strict immutability guard.
- Cross‑Platform Compatibility: 6 — Node path is solid; Workers path not implemented for config (tsconfig excludes src/config/**; crypto uses Node). No Worker adapter for loader/secrets.
- Integration Quality: 9 — Clean integration via DependencyContainer; updates MasterServer (servers, capabilities, routing) and redacts sensitive fields in logs.

Average: 8.0 (PASS)

## Security & Reliability Assessment
- Secrets: Uses `env:` indirection and `enc:gcm:` at‑rest encryption. Missing key in production throws, which is correct. Redaction masks keys/passwords/tokens in audit logs.
- Reliability: Config reload guarded by schema validation; failure to apply logs a warning and retains the previous in‑memory state. No explicit rollback snapshotting or rate limiting.
- Exposure: Default schema is permissive (`additionalProperties: true`), which reduces false negatives but allows unnoticed typos. Consider stricter validation for critical sections.

## Verification Notes
- Schema validation: `src/config/schema-validator.ts` validates required/enum/url/integer and nested objects/arrays; loads repo schema at `config/schema.json` or falls back to built‑in schema.
- Environment management: `src/config/environment-manager.ts` detects env, discovers `config/default.json` + `{env}.json`, maps many `MASTER_*` env vars, and supports `--dotted.path=value` CLI overrides.
- Secret handling: `src/config/secret-manager.ts` resolves `enc:gcm:` and `env:` placeholders, redacts logs, and supports rotation via re‑encrypt.
- Loader and merge: `src/config/config-loader.ts` merges file→env→CLI, validates, resolves secrets, and returns typed config. JSON/YAML supported in Node. Arrays replace by default.
- Hot‑reload: `src/server/config-manager.ts` watches files (Node) and emits updates; `DependencyContainer` applies changes to auth, servers, capabilities, and routing.
- Cross‑platform: Workers build excludes config subsystem per `tsconfig.worker.json`; no Worker adapter for loader/secrets; SecretManager relies on Node crypto.

## Recommendations (Critical First)
1) Cross‑Platform Adapters
   - Add a Worker‑compatible `SecretManager` using Web Crypto (`crypto.subtle`) and an abstraction over crypto. Provide a Worker `ConfigLoader` that reads from bindings/remote JSON rather than filesystem.
   - Remove `src/config/**` exclusion in Worker build once adapters exist; use capability checks to select Node vs Worker paths.

2) Stronger Validation
   - Replace or augment the custom validator with Ajv (+ TypeBox) or Zod. Implement discriminated unions for `auth_strategy` and provider‑specific `auth_config` requirements, and add cross‑field invariants (e.g., prohibit `hosting.port` collisions, require endpoints for PROXY_OAUTH).
   - Consider `additionalProperties: false` for critical sections to catch typos.

3) Hot‑Reload Safety
   - Implement two‑phase apply with snapshot + rollback on failure; restrict changes for non‑hot fields (ports, server topology) and surface a “restart required” state.
   - Debounce file events; add basic backoff for repeated failures.

4) Environment Layering
   - Add a `config/local.json` (git‑ignored) layer and optional `extends` support to compose config files; document precedence clearly. Support env var prefix mapping (e.g., `MCP_` with `__` path separator) for portability.

5) Observability
   - Emit structured diagnostics on validation failures (path, message, suggestion) and attach a concise audit record for applied config versions.

6) Tests
   - Unit tests for merge precedence, env mapping, secret resolution, and schema invariants. Integration tests for hot‑reload apply/rollback hooks.

## Conclusion
Phase 6 meets the core goals with a solid Node implementation and clean integration, passing the rubric with an average score of 8.0. Addressing Worker compatibility, stronger validation, and hot‑reload safety will harden the system for production and ensure parity across deployment platforms.
